# Tester-of-CMOS-gates-
# This is the tester of CMOS gates, they’re used a lot in electronics so i said to myself that i could create one, the reason i’m giving it online is that you all can later create code for your own CMOS gates, couse i only created program for six gates (7432, 7408, 4001, 7400, 7420, 7404/7414), i will later work on some more codes for this tester too, but for now i’ll keep it up to you, if you will create code for some more gates.

# As i mentioned in the discription of the eagle files, you should only use the .sch file, the board isn’t finished, it is due to i selected to only route the bottom layer (i dont have any PCBs with two layers), but you can create gerber files and send it for example to JLC PCB, they will do it very precisly (probably).

# Thank you.
